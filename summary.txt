In this project, I analyze simulated learner data. This simulated data was supplied by Codecademy. Such data is similar to actual learner data that curriculum teams would be interested in drawing conclusions from.

The codecademy DataFrame head:
   score  completed    lesson
0   82.7       35.0  Lesson A
1   65.2       31.0  Lesson A
2   55.3       33.0  Lesson A
3   28.8       25.0  Lesson B
4   31.2       18.0  Lesson B

There appears to be a linear relationship between the x-variable (content items completed) and the y-variable (quiz score) based on the scatter plot, with the following coefficients:

Intercept    13.214113
completed     1.306826
dtype: float64

The intercept (Intercept) is 13.21. This intercept suggests that if a user completed 0 content items, they would receive a score of 13.21/100. The slope is 1.31. This slope (completed) indicates that for every 1 content item completed, the user's score can be expected to rise by 1.31 points.

39.350624877322936
A user who previously completed 20 content items is expected to score 39.35 points on the quiz based on our linear regression model.

We plot a histogram of the residuals to check the normality assumption for linear regression.
The residuals histogram appears to be normally distributed.

We check the homoscedasticity assumption for linear regression by scatterplotting the residuals by the fitted values.
The scatter plot appears to meet the homoscedasticity assumption, as the points are randomly scattered and form no patterns.

We now seek to answer the question: Do learners who take lesson A or B perform better on the quiz? We create a boxplot to answer this question. 

Based on the boxplot, it is clear that students who took Lesson A immediately before the quiz outperform those who took Lesson B.

We now create and fit a linear regression model that predicts score using lesson as the predictor.

Intercept             59.220
lesson[T.Lesson B]   -11.642
dtype: float64

The intercept (Intercept) is 59.22. This indicates that learners who took Lesson A received a mean score of 59.22 on the quiz. The slope (lesson[T.Lesson B]) is -11.64. This indicates that learners who took Lesson B received a mean score 11.64 points LESS than 59.22 (the mean score for Lesson A takers).

The mean quiz score for learners who took lesson A is 59.22.
The mean quiz score for learners who took lesson B is 47.58.
The mean difference is 11.64.

Lastly, we plot score by number of learning items completed, colored by lesson for even more insight into the data.
